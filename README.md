Maga's Recipe Book

Who's Maga?
Back in the late 2000s, my cousin Nicolas, while learning to talk, nicknamed our Grandma Kathy, Maga! We've been calling her that since! Maga was born in Canada and emigrated to the US with the love her life Hans. They had two lovely children, Kevin and Tara. Maga enjoys golf, traveling, and spending time with her family. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, Maga really loves cooking and baking food!

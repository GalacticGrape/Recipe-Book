Sample script:

# Within a try block, the script initiates a connection to the MySQL server.

# Specify the path to the .env file
dotenv_path = r"S:\Python\.env"

# Load environment variables from .env file

# Retrieve environment variables

db_user = os.getenv("DB_USER")
db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")

    # Create a connection to the database
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(
        host=db_host,
        user=db_user,

        database=db_name
    )

    # Create a cursor object using the connection
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    # The script creates a table named recipe_categories with a single column category_name of type VARCHAR(255).
